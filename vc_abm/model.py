                                   level. E.g. with [0.3, 0,1, 0.4], each actor in level 1 has a probability of

                                          matrix. The vacancy transition probability matrix is a NxN+1 matrix;
                                          N=number of levels and the last column indicates the probability of a vacancy
                                          retiring, i.e. of calling in an actor from outside the system. If e.g. N=3:

                                                      Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Retire

                                          Some example of interpretations are "a vacancy in level 1 has a 0.4
                                          probability of moving within level 1", or "a vacancy in level 3 has a
                                          probability of 0.1 to retire" or "a vacancy in level 3 has a probability of
                                          0.3 to move to level 2".
                                          NB: rows must sum to 1.
                                          NB: this code assumes that higher rows represent higher levels in the
                                          hierarchy, so level 1 > 2 > 3
                                          Further details on vacancy movements can be found in entity.vacancy.step

        :param firing_schedule: dict, indicating how actors' retirement probabilities should be changed at the specified
                                actor-steps. So, e.g. {"steps": {5, 6, 7}, "ret probs": [0.4, 0.4, 0.6]}
                                means that at each of actor-steps five, six, and seven, the retirement probability of
                                each actor in level 1 will be 0.4, the retirement probability of each actor in level 2
                                will be 0.4, and the retirement probability of each actor in level 3 will be 0.6. Before
                                step five and after step seven we use the actor retirement probabilities given by
                                actor_retire_probs

        :param growth_orders: dict, indicating how many positions should be added to different levels, at the specified
                              actor-steps. So, e.g. {"steps": {7, 8}, "extra positions": [10, 50, 150]} means
                              that at each of actor-steps seven and eight we will add ten new positions in level one,
                              fifty new positions in level two, and one hundred and fifty new positions in level three.
                              Before step seven and after step eight we do not increase the size of the system.

        :param shrink_orders: dict, indicating how many positions should be removed from different levels, at the
                              specified actor-steps. So, e.g. {"steps": {5, 6}, "num to remove": [4, 20, 13]} means
                              that at each of actor-steps five and six we will remove four positions in level 1,
                              twenty positions in level two, and thirteen positions in level three. Before step five and
                              after step six we do not decrease the size of the system.

        :param start_fraction_female: float, gender ratio with which we initialise actors at the beginning of the model,
                                     e.g. 0.6 means that at model initialisation sixty percent of all actors are female

        :param prob_female_entry_per_step: dict, indicating the probability that an actor called from the outside by
                                           a vacancy retirement will be female, at the designated actor steps. So,
                                           e.g. {20: 0.6, 21: 0.7, 22: 0.7} means that at actor step twenty each
                                           newly-called actor has a probability of 0.6 of being female, while at each
                                           of actor steps twenty-one and twenty-two each newly-called actor has a
                                           probability of 0.7 of being female.
                                           NB: this dict must be defined for ALL actor-steps of the model

        :param vacancy_benefit_deficit_matrix: changes in some unit associated with vacancy movements. E.g. this matrix

                                               [[1, 2, 3, 4],
                                                [-1, 3, 4, 5],
                                                [-2, -1, 5, 6]]

                                               refers to changes in a family's utility as it moves up or down the
                                               "niceness" scale of housing: moves up increase utility, moves down
                                               decrease it.

        :param data_collector: dict, indicating the data collector functions that harvest measures from the model.
                               Has form {"title_of_data_collector":name_of_collector_function"}.
                               NB: data collector functions live in collectors.py

        :param shock_step: int, an actor-step at which a shock of particular note occurs, e.g. a major system expansion.
                           By default shock_step == 0.

        :param vacancy_move_period: int, the number of model steps that we give vacancies to work their way out of the
                                    system. The classic, simplest formulation of vacancy chain analysis assumed that
                                    vacancies make their way out of the system within some natural time unit, like a
                                    year, which here is operationalised as the "actor-step". In model terms, the
                                    vacancy_move_period is the number of model steps BETWEEN actor steps; only vacancies
                                    are allowed to move in these "vacancy steps" and only actors can move during "actor
                                    steps". By default this is 0, i.e. vacancies move as often as actors.
                                    NB: adjust this number by consulting collectors.get_count_vacancies_still_in_system
