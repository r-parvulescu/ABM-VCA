        Vacancies can swap positions with actors already in the system, or retire and put an outside actor in their
        position.

        By convention the vacancy transition probability matrix is a NxN+1 matrix; N=number of levels and the last
        column indicates the probability of a vacancy retiring, i.e. of calling in an actor from outside the system.

        If e.g. N=3 then:

                    Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Retire
        Level 1       0.3         0.4         0.1        0.2
        Level 2       0.1         0.4         0.4        0.1
        Level 3       0.05        0.05        0.2        0.7

        Some example of interpretation are "a vacancy in level 1 has a 0.4 probability of moving within level 1", or
        "a vacancy in level 3 has a probability of 0.1 to retire" or "a vacancy in level 3 has a probability of 0.3 to
        move to level 2".

        If we see this matrix referring to a 3-level hierarchy where "1" is the highest level, the above transition
        probability matrix depicts a system where vacancies tend to move down (thereby promoting actors up), stay in
        their level (thereby encouraging lateral actor moves) and retire (thereby recruiting outside actors).

        NB: this transition probability matrix ONLY depicts movement, i.e. there is no choice for a vacancy to stay put.

        In this model vacancies do not move in "natural time", i.e. in the actor steps. Rather, they move in artificial
        "vacancy steps." This two-step system is designed so that all vacancy steps will occur in the span of one
        actor step, i.e. so that a vacancy chain exhausts itself in one unit of natural time. The substantive purpose is
        to ensure that no positions are vacant for more than one turn, which is reasonable for instance of employment
        organisations, where a job kept empty for a year will often be abolished. If this 1-actor-step limit is too
        harsh, we can relax it and allow positions to be vacant for 2, 3, etc. years.

        Vacancies must coordinate with each other to ensure orderly movement. The rules of vacancy movement are:
        1) vacancies may only move into spots occupied by actors
        2) vacancies may never move an actor that has joined the system in their current actor step
        3) vacancies may never move an actor that has already been moved by other vacancies in their current actor step
        4) if N>1 vacancies want to move into the same actor-occupied spot, they toss an N-sided die and the winner of
           the toss gets to move into said spot. All the other ones forfeit this turn of this vacancy movement.

        NB: vacancies have 49 internal steps to move around; they omit every fiftieth step
