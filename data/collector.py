    they have an increase in utils, and the opposite for moving to less nice housing. This matrix also suggests
    decreasing marginal utility of housing niceness, since people lower down the niceness hierarchy gain more from
    moving up or having a new unit built (presumably pulling people out of homelessness) than people moving within or
    between higher levels.

    Thus function calculates net benefits of vacancy movements, disaggregated by the level in which the vacancy started.
