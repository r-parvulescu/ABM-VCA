    Things get much more complicated when an experiment features the addition of a new hierarchical level. Essentially,
    the problem is what the datacollector functions go from a typology with n-levels to one with n+1 levels, in which
    the new level can be squeezed in between the old ones. For example, if we introduce a new level in rank 2 (i.e.
    second from top position) in a three level system, we end up with the following mapping of level names:

    Old Level Typology    New Level Typology
            1                     1
                                  2 (the new level added in)
            2                     3
            3                     4

    The problem is that as far as the computer is concerned, levels 2 and 3 continue throughout and leven 4 is the
    genuinely new one, but really level 2 is new and 3 and 4 are just re-namings. To obtain non-spurious graphing, we
    need to ensure, for example, that the time-series from the old level 2 connects seamlessly to the time-series from
    the new level 3 (which is just the old level 2, but with a new name). Likewise, we need to assign a distinct colour
    for the genuinely new level (the new level 2).

    This function achieves this by segmenting the lines at the point of new level introduction, then
    re-colouring and padding them to ensure smooth transitions and clear identification.

    It's all very cluge-y, but trying to handle this issue upstream in the datacollectors risks messing up dependencies.

    NB: levels are hierachically ranked in reverese order, i.e. 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 ...

    NB: recall that the actual data lines are pandas.Series objects
